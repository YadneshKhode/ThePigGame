    <h1>GAME RULES</h1> 
    <ul>
      <li>The game has 2 players, playing in rounds</li>
      <li>In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he wishes. Each result gets added to the ROUND score</li>
      <li>But, if the player rolls a 1 in any dice all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn</li>
      <li>If the player rolls two consecutive 6 then the player looses his entire score.</li>
      <li>The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his individual score. After that, it's the next player's turn</li>
      <li>The first player to reach maximum points entered by you wins the game</li>
      <li>If you did not enter any maximum points then it is set to 100</li>
    </ul>
